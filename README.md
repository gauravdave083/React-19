# React-19

What’s new in React 19 

Actions 
A common use case in React apps is to perform a data mutation and then update state in response. For example, when a user submits a form to change their name, you will make an API request, and then handle the response. In the past, you would need to handle pending states, errors, optimistic updates, and sequential requests manually.

For example, you could handle the pending and error state in useState:

// Before Actions
function UpdateName({}) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    setIsPending(true);
    const error = await updateName(name);
    setIsPending(false);
    if (error) {
      setError(error);
      return;
    } 
    redirect("/path");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}


In React 19, we’re adding support for using async functions in transitions to handle pending states, errors, forms, and optimistic updates automatically.
For example, you can use useTransition to handle the pending state for you:

// Using pending state from Actions
function UpdateName({}) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      const error = await updateName(name);
      if (error) {
        setError(error);
        return;
      } 
      redirect("/path");
    })
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}


The async transition will immediately set the isPending state to true, make the async request(s), and switch isPending to false after any transitions. This allows you to keep the current UI responsive and interactive while the data is changing.

Note:
By convention, functions that use async transitions are called “Actions”. 
Actions automatically manage submitting data for you:

Pending state: Actions provide a pending state that starts at the beginning of a request and automatically resets when the final state update is committed.
Optimistic updates: Actions support the new useOptimistic hook so you can show users instant feedback while the requests are submitting.
Error handling: Actions provide error handling so you can display Error Boundaries when a request fails, and revert optimistic updates to their original value automatically.
Forms: <form> elements now support passing functions to the action and formAction props. Passing functions to the action props use Actions by default and reset the form automatically after submission.
Building on top of Actions, React 19 introduces useOptimistic to manage optimistic updates, and a new hook React.useActionState to handle common cases for Actions. In react-dom we’re adding <form> Actions to manage forms automatically and useFormStatus to support the common cases for Actions in forms.

In React 19, the above example can be simplified to:

// Using <form> Actions and useActionState
function ChangeName({ name, setName }) {
  const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    async (previousState, formData) => {
      const error = await updateName(formData.get("name"));
      if (error) {
        return error;
      }
      redirect("/path");
      return null;
    },
    null,
  );

  return (
    <form action={submitAction}>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>Update</button>
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}

In the next section, we’ll break down each of the new Action features in React 19.

New hook: useActionState 
To make the common cases easier for Actions, we’ve added a new hook called useActionState:

const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  async (previousState, newName) => {
    const error = await updateName(newName);
    if (error) {
      // You can return any result of the action.
      // Here, we return only the error.
      return error;
    }
    return null;
  },
  null,
);


useActionState accepts a function (the “Action”), and returns a wrapped Action to call. This works because Actions compose. When the wrapped Action is called, useActionState will return the last result of the Action as data, and the pending state of the Action as pending.

Note
React.useActionState was previously called ReactDOM.useFormState in the Canary releases, but we’ve renamed it and deprecated useFormState.


For more information, see the docs for useActionState.

React DOM: <form> Actions 
Actions are also integrated with React 19’s new <form> features for react-dom. We’ve added support for passing functions as the action and formAction props of <form>, <input>, and <button> elements to automatically submit forms with Actions:

<form action={actionFunction}>
When a <form> Action succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. If you need to reset the <form> manually, you can call the new requestFormReset React DOM API.

For more information, see the react-dom docs for <form>, <input>, and <button>.

React DOM: New hook: useFormStatus 
In design systems, it’s common to write design components that need access to information about the <form> they’re in, without drilling props down to the component. This can be done via Context, but to make the common case easier, we’ve added a new hook useFormStatus:

import {useFormStatus} from 'react-dom';

function DesignButton() {
  const {pending} = useFormStatus();
  return <button type="submit" disabled={pending} />
}
useFormStatus reads the status of the parent <form> as if the form was a Context provider.

For more information, see the react-dom docs for useFormStatus.

New hook: useOptimistic 
Another common UI pattern when performing a data mutation is to show the final state optimistically while the async request is underway. In React 19, we’re adding a new hook called useOptimistic to make this easier:

function ChangeName({currentName, onUpdateName}) {
  const [optimisticName, setOptimisticName] = useOptimistic(currentName);

  const submitAction = async formData => {
    const newName = formData.get("name");
    setOptimisticName(newName);
    const updatedName = await updateName(newName);
    onUpdateName(updatedName);
  };

  return (
    <form action={submitAction}>
      <p>Your name is: {optimisticName}</p>
      <p>
        <label>Change Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          disabled={currentName !== optimisticName}
        />
      </p>
    </form>
  );
}
The useOptimistic hook will immediately render the optimisticName while the updateName request is in progress. When the update finishes or errors, React will automatically switch back to the currentName value.

For more information, see the docs for useOptimistic.

New API: use 
In React 19 we’re introducing a new API to read resources in render: use.

For example, you can read a promise with use, and React will Suspend until the promise resolves:

import {use} from 'react';

function Comments({commentsPromise}) {
  // `use` will suspend until the promise resolves.
  const comments = use(commentsPromise);
  return comments.map(comment => <p key={comment.id}>{comment}</p>);
}

function Page({commentsPromise}) {
  // When `use` suspends in Comments,
  // this Suspense boundary will be shown.
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Comments commentsPromise={commentsPromise} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
Note
use does not support promises created in render. 
If you try to pass a promise created in render to use, React will warn:

Console
A component was suspended by an uncached promise. Creating promises inside a Client Component or hook is not yet supported, except via a Suspense-compatible library or framework.
To fix, you need to pass a promise from a suspense powered library or framework that supports caching for promises. In the future we plan to ship features to make it easier to cache promises in render.

You can also read context with use, allowing you to read Context conditionally such as after early returns:

import {use} from 'react';
import ThemeContext from './ThemeContext'

function Heading({children}) {
  if (children == null) {
    return null;
  }
  
  // This would not work with useContext
  // because of the early return.
  const theme = use(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <h1 style={{color: theme.color}}>
      {children}
    </h1>
  );
}
The use API can only be called in render, similar to hooks. Unlike hooks, use can be called conditionally. In the future we plan to support more ways to consume resources in render with use.

For more information, see the docs for use.

React Server Components 
Server Components 
Server Components are a new option that allows rendering components ahead of time, before bundling, in an environment separate from your client application or SSR server. This separate environment is the “server” in React Server Components. Server Components can run once at build time on your CI server, or they can be run for each request using a web server.

React 19 includes all of the React Server Components features included from the Canary channel. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture.

Note
How do I build support for Server Components? 
While React Server Components in React 19 are stable and will not break between major versions, the underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x.

To support React Server Components as a bundler or framework, we recommend pinning to a specific React version, or using the Canary release. We will continue working with bundlers and frameworks to stabilize the APIs used to implement React Server Components in the future.

For more, see the docs for React Server Components.

Server Actions 
Server Actions allow Client Components to call async functions executed on the server.

When a Server Action is defined with the "use server" directive, your framework will automatically create a reference to the server function, and pass that reference to the Client Component. When that function is called on the client, React will send a request to the server to execute the function, and return the result.

Note
There is no directive for Server Components. 
A common misunderstanding is that Server Components are denoted by "use server", but there is no directive for Server Components. The "use server" directive is used for Server Actions.

For more info, see the docs for Directives.

Server Actions can be created in Server Components and passed as props to Client Components, or they can be imported and used in Client Components.

For more, see the docs for React Server Actions.

Improvements in React 19 
ref as a prop 
Starting in React 19, you can now access ref as a prop for function components:

function MyInput({placeholder, ref}) {
  return <input placeholder={placeholder} ref={ref} />
}

//...
<MyInput ref={ref} />
New function components will no longer need forwardRef, and we will be publishing a codemod to automatically update your components to use the new ref prop. In future versions we will deprecate and remove forwardRef.

Note
refs passed to classes are not passed as props since they reference the component instance.

Diffs for hydration errors 
We also improved error reporting for hydration errors in react-dom. For example, instead of logging multiple errors in DEV without any information about the mismatch:

Console
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: “Server” Client: “Client”
  at span
  at App
Warning: An error occurred during hydration. The server HTML was replaced with client content in <div>.
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: “Server” Client: “Client”
  at span
  at App
Warning: An error occurred during hydration. The server HTML was replaced with client content in <div>.
Uncaught Error: Text content does not match server-rendered HTML.
  at checkForUnmatchedText
  …
We now log a single message with a diff of the mismatch:

Console
Uncaught Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn’t match the client. As a result this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if an SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch if (typeof window !== 'undefined').
- Variable input such as Date.now() or Math.random() which changes each time it’s called.
- Date formatting in a user’s locale which doesn’t match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

https://react.dev/link/hydration-mismatch 

  <App>
    <span>
+    Client
-    Server

  at throwOnHydrationMismatch
  …
<Context> as a provider 
In React 19, you can render <Context> as a provider instead of <Context.Provider>:

const ThemeContext = createContext('');

function App({children}) {
  return (
    <ThemeContext value="dark">
      {children}
    </ThemeContext>
  );  
}
New Context providers can use <Context> and we will be publishing a codemod to convert existing providers. In future versions we will deprecate <Context.Provider>.

Cleanup functions for refs 
We now support returning a cleanup function from ref callbacks:

<input
  ref={(ref) => {
    // ref created

    // NEW: return a cleanup function to reset
    // the ref when element is removed from DOM.
    return () => {
      // ref cleanup
    };
  }}
/>
When the component unmounts, React will call the cleanup function returned from the ref callback. This works for DOM refs, refs to class components, and useImperativeHandle.

Note
Previously, React would call ref functions with null when unmounting the component. If your ref returns a cleanup function, React will now skip this step.

In future versions, we will deprecate calling refs with null when unmounting components.

Due to the introduction of ref cleanup functions, returning anything else from a ref callback will now be rejected by TypeScript. The fix is usually to stop using implicit returns, for example:

- <div ref={current => (instance = current)} />
+ <div ref={current => {instance = current}} />
The original code returned the instance of the HTMLDivElement and TypeScript wouldn’t know if this was supposed to be a cleanup function or if you didn’t want to return a cleanup function.

You can codemod this pattern with no-implicit-ref-callback-return.

useDeferredValue initial value 
We’ve added an initialValue option to useDeferredValue:

function Search({deferredValue}) {
  // On initial render the value is ''.
  // Then a re-render is scheduled with the deferredValue.
  const value = useDeferredValue(deferredValue, '');
  
  return (
    <Results query={value} />
  );
}
When initialValue is provided, useDeferredValue will return it as value for the initial render of the component, and schedules a re-render in the background with the deferredValue returned.

For more, see useDeferredValue.

Support for Document Metadata 
In HTML, document metadata tags like <title>, <link>, and <meta> are reserved for placement in the <head> section of the document. In React, the component that decides what metadata is appropriate for the app may be very far from the place where you render the <head> or React does not render the <head> at all. In the past, these elements would need to be inserted manually in an effect, or by libraries like react-helmet, and required careful handling when server rendering a React application.

In React 19, we’re adding support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively:

function BlogPost({post}) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <title>{post.title}</title>
      <meta name="author" content="Josh" />
      <link rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/joshcstory/" />
      <meta name="keywords" content={post.keywords} />
      <p>
        Eee equals em-see-squared...
      </p>
    </article>
  );
}
When React renders this component, it will see the <title> <link> and <meta> tags, and automatically hoist them to the <head> section of document. By supporting these metadata tags natively, we’re able to ensure they work with client-only apps, streaming SSR, and Server Components.

Note
You may still want a Metadata library 
For simple use cases, rendering Document Metadata as tags may be suitable, but libraries can offer more powerful features like overriding generic metadata with specific metadata based on the current route. These features make it easier for frameworks and libraries like react-helmet to support metadata tags, rather than replace them.

For more info, see the docs for <title>, <link>, and <meta>.

Support for stylesheets 
Stylesheets, both externally linked (<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">) and inline (<style>...</style>), require careful positioning in the DOM due to style precedence rules. Building a stylesheet capability that allows for composability within components is hard, so users often end up either loading all of their styles far from the components that may depend on them, or they use a style library which encapsulates this complexity.

In React 19, we’re addressing this complexity and providing even deeper integration into Concurrent Rendering on the Client and Streaming Rendering on the Server with built in support for stylesheets. If you tell React the precedence of your stylesheet it will manage the insertion order of the stylesheet in the DOM and ensure that the stylesheet (if external) is loaded before revealing content that depends on those style rules.

function ComponentOne() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback="loading...">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="foo" precedence="default" />
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="bar" precedence="high" />
      <article class="foo-class bar-class">
        {...}
      </article>
    </Suspense>
  )
}

function ComponentTwo() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{...}</p>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="baz" precedence="default" />  <-- will be inserted between foo & bar
    </div>
  )
}
During Server Side Rendering React will include the stylesheet in the <head>, which ensures that the browser will not paint until it has loaded. If the stylesheet is discovered late after we’ve already started streaming, React will ensure that the stylesheet is inserted into the <head> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.

During Client Side Rendering React will wait for newly rendered stylesheets to load before committing the render. If you render this component from multiple places within your application React will only include the stylesheet once in the document:

function App() {
  return <>
    <ComponentOne />
    ...
    <ComponentOne /> // won't lead to a duplicate stylesheet link in the DOM
  </>
}
For users accustomed to loading stylesheets manually this is an opportunity to locate those stylesheets alongside the components that depend on them allowing for better local reasoning and an easier time ensuring you only load the stylesheets that you actually depend on.

Style libraries and style integrations with bundlers can also adopt this new capability so even if you don’t directly render your own stylesheets, you can still benefit as your tools are upgraded to use this feature.

For more details, read the docs for <link> and <style>.
